# SyncMobile for xBrowserSync

xBrowserSync Firefox add-on modified to remove browser bookmark editing so it works when installed in GeckoView-based mobile browsers. This add-on does not sync browser bookmarks and only allows you to access bookmarks synced with xBrowserSync from other browsers. This add-on is not affiliated with xBrowserSync in any way, but is based on the code of their desktop add-on and Android app.
